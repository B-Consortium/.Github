The Broke Consortium or referred to by a member as "Research, Provisions, Successors, and the Member of the Broke Consortium" or as "Broke Consortium of Mathematical Research", in short reffered to as B-Consortium was formed on 22 May, 2023 after the end of BS Consortium, and intends to work openly as a self-proclaimed, un-registered not-for-profit research organization, to help about the computational, and non-trivial mathematical fields to change around.

The consortium has adopted procdures to remain open-sourced, to all respect of open-source rights of access. This implies the open-reach access of all activities to any person thereof with benefits of to any student of the acceding high school of the consortium. As per One-Member implementation, this organization is only runned by [Aitzaz Imtiaz](https://github.com/AitzazImtiaz/") in attempts to power applications which are mathematically efficient.

Algorithms or thereof conventions of B-Consortium are made for public interest, the consortium inspired by mathematician [Sophie Germain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophie_Germain) wants to serve a greater cause to human advancement. In its best:

 - THe consortium will have all it's projects use ``B License``
 - You are requested but not required to cite the correct source
 - The consortium will not be liable for any harms you make from derived products
 - The consortium is not a business, nor a legal joint of some companies, to avoid any legal problems, thereof it must be agreed; the consortium is philosophically named and reffered due to "association" in latin, in terms of associating it to the society well-being.

The products by the consortium and research derived of, is intended to bring novel, original contributions where in nature unique ideas are derived out. Where possible, the consortium will tag out ideas that lack any sort of novelty. 

The consortium assures the following:

|Sr.|Standard Rules|Applied?|
|--|--|--|
|1.|The consortium will implement libraries, CLI's, interfaces, but the consortium in this research activity will take no aid of any graphical interfaces, whatever the neccessity is.| :heavy_check_mark: |
|2.|The consortium will never associate itself to money making means, trying to attain any source of money to have respect of true philosophy, and to promote all kinds of philnatrophy, giving freedom to use all its products| :heavy_check_mark: |
|3.|The consortium will be reluctant to collaborate with other un-associated entities, to make any project but only recieve issues, comments and sugestions in improvements. This SR applies to keep sure all copyrights are reserved for others while the consortium will keep its mission of philantrophy| :heavy_check_mark: |
|4.|You are not allowed to copyright any public domain consortium tool. When making a new tool out of the existing consortium tool, regardless of nature, you are given freedom to give any credit or not to consortium. The consortium will always encourage your derivations of your tools, if you find them before the consortium does. The consortium will not any claim on your derivatives nor require you to cite consortium for the derivatives regardless the fact the consortium was original credible source of idea| :heavy_check_mark: |
|5.|The consortium will strictly determine what benefits humanity or not, no harmful tools like predecessor BS Consortium made shall be utilized but remain classified property of B Consortium. From the date of consortium formation be, no further development will be taken into any cyber-weapon use or development| :heavy_check_mark: |

### Policy on AitSad
[AitSad](https://github.com/AitSad) was formed during "The Great Depression" of Novemer-February 2023, as a branch to BS Consortium, to create tideous libraries to keep work for BS Consortium eased. AitSad is acquisitioned by B Consortium, which remains a final decision. Further decisions are yet to be made.
